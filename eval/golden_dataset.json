    "question": "What grind size should I use for a French press?",
    "expected_keywords": ["coarse", "french press", "steep", "muddy"],
    "expected_answer": "For French press, use a coarse grind — like coarsely ground sea salt. A finer grind clogs the mesh filter and makes the cup muddy and bitter. Steep for 4 minutes, press slowly, and pour immediately."

    "question": "What is the ideal coffee-to-water ratio for pour-over?",
    "expected_keywords": ["1:15", "1:16", "1:17", "ratio", "grams"],
    "expected_answer": "A standard starting ratio for pour-over is 1:15 to 1:17 (coffee:water by weight). For a 20g dose of coffee, use 300–340g of water."

    "question": "Why does my espresso taste sour?",
    "expected_keywords": ["under-extraction", "finer", "grind", "temperature", "time"],
    "expected_answer": "Sourness in espresso usually indicates under-extraction. Try a finer grind, increase shot time to 25–30 seconds, or slightly raise water temperature to 92–94°C."

    "question": "What water temperature is best for brewing light roast coffee?",
    "expected_keywords": ["94", "95", "96", "light", "higher", "temperature"],
    "expected_answer": "Light roasts benefit from higher water temperatures, around 94–96°C (201–205°F), because they need more heat to fully extract the complex flavors."

    "question": "How do I make cold brew at home?",
    "expected_keywords": ["coarse", "ratio", "refrigerate", "hours", "steep"],
    "expected_answer": "Use a 1:8 ratio of coarsely ground coffee to cold water. Steep in the refrigerator for 12–24 hours, then strain through a paper filter or fine mesh. Dilute 1:1 before serving."

    "question": "What flavor notes are typical of Ethiopian coffee?",
    "expected_keywords": ["blueberry", "floral", "jasmine", "bright", "fruity", "berry"],
    "expected_answer": "Ethiopian coffees are known for bright, fruity, and floral characteristics. Common tasting notes include blueberry, jasmine, bergamot, and stone fruit, especially in washed processing."

    "question": "What does 'bloom' mean in pour-over brewing?",
    "expected_keywords": ["bloom", "co2", "gas", "pre-infusion", "degas", "30"],
    "expected_answer": "The bloom (or pre-infusion) is the initial pour of a small amount of hot water over the grounds — about twice the weight of coffee. It degasses CO2 trapped in fresh coffee, which would otherwise create uneven extraction. Bloom for about 30–45 seconds."

    "question": "How does roast level affect caffeine content?",
    "expected_keywords": ["light", "dark", "similar", "caffeine", "roast", "myth"],
    "expected_answer": "Despite common belief, roast level has minimal effect on caffeine content by weight. Light and dark roasts have roughly the same caffeine per gram. The difference feels larger because dark roast beans are less dense, so a scoop of dark roast may have slightly less caffeine by weight but slightly more by volume."

    "question": "What is TDS in coffee and why does it matter?",
    "expected_keywords": ["tds", "total dissolved solids", "strength", "extraction", "refractometer"],
    "expected_answer": "TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) measures the concentration of dissolved coffee compounds in your cup — essentially, how strong the coffee is. It's measured with a refractometer. The SCA recommends 1.15–1.35% TDS for brewed coffee. TDS combined with brew ratio tells you extraction yield."

    "question": "How do I clean my burr grinder?",
    "expected_keywords": ["brush", "burr", "rice", "grindz", "residue", "clean"],
    "expected_answer": "For routine cleaning, use a stiff brush to remove grounds from the burrs and chamber after each use. For deeper cleaning, run a small amount of grinder cleaning tablets (like Grindz) through, or carefully disassemble and brush the burrs. Avoid water on burrs — it causes rust."
